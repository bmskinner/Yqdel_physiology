Datasets and scripts for Rathje et al - Differential sperm motility mediates the sex ratio drive shaping mouse sex chromosome evolution

The measurements of pre-FISH nuclei exported from Nuclear Morphology Analysis are in Raw_data.
They should be unzipped before running the analysis.

The R script ```createCharts.R``` performs the analyses and generates charts. The other R files contain helper functions.

Supplementary tables containing the breeding data are also in the Raw_data folder.

```Two_cell_recovery.csv``` contains the results of the 2-cell recovery experiment, and ```Embryo_data.csv``` contains the details on recovered embryos with different maternal and paternal genotype combinations.
